<p>I'm <a href="/archive/no-more-stuff">not that big on stuff</a>, but the few possessions I <em>do</em> have, I'm pretty attached to. I've seen a few folks post their <a href="https://www.srsbsns.lol/uses/">everyday carry</a> or <a href="https://hypr.moe/inventory/">personal inventories</a>, so I thought it'd be fun to share mine. This is all stuff I've found that works best for my personal context; if yours is similar to mine, you may find some of it useful. I'm not making a commission or anything, this is all stuff I actually recommend.</p>

<h2>Backpack</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>This was a very expensive purchase I made in 2017, when I was still single and making what (for the time) was a decent income. It was a "buy it for life" decision, because I was sick of buying cheap backpacks and having them fall apart within a year. This one's a little beat up, and some of the zippers have broken off, but I don't doubt it'll be a functional backpack for the rest of my life. It has a lifetime warranty, and I could probably send it back and have the zippers fixed, but that could take weeks and in that time I wouldn't have a backpack, so I haven't taken them up on it yet. I think visible mending is cool, but the paperclips are maybe not the coolest example of it. I'd like to figure out a more attractive solution.</p>

<h2>Wallet</h2>

<p>I bought this when I got my passport in 2016. It's held together quite well (the passport, not so much.) I don't really care about the RFID blocking, I don't think having my credit card data skimmed from the NFC chip is a plausible threat model, this was just the most affordable leather passport wallet I could find at the time. So far it's been a very good buy.</p>

<h2>Watch</h2>

</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/msOp6RZ.jpeg" alt="alt text" title="" /></p>

<p>Like the backpack, I bought this because I was sick of buying new watches every year. I've had this one for about 3 years and the fabric band is holding up well; more importantly, it's designed so I can replace it myself without special tools if it ever does break. Sorry about the scratch, that's my fault. I try not to think about it.</p>

<h2>Headphones</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Critical piece of gear. Wireless hearing protector headphones help me go out into the world without my worst sensory issues being triggered. Vital for bus rides, walking near traffic, big box grocery stores, obnoxious neighbors, hot rod drivers, fireworks, crowds, fans and air conditioners, sirens, pretty much every aspect of urban life. I replaced the foam ear cushions with the silicon gel ones so I can wear them all day, which I do. Both things typically last 1-2 years.</p>

<h2>Phone</h2>

<ul>

<p>I wrote about this in <a href="https://bluelander.bearblog.dev/samsung-a16">a previous entry</a>. It's "fine". It's also my camera, ebook reader, mp3 player, GPS, compass, calculator, calendar, translator, notebook and alarm clock, so it cuts down on the number of things I have to carry around every day considerably. There are a lot of downsides to the smartphone business model, but needing to buy and replace all of those things separately would arguably be worse. 🤷‍♀️</p>

<h2>Speaker</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Shockingly good for its size. I wouldn't want to listen to all  my music on it, but for occasional background music or podcast listening, it punches above its weight. Doesn't get nearly as much use as the headphones, but it comes in handy sometimes.</p>

<h2>What's actually in my bag</h2>

<p>Aside from the speaker, I always have snacks, medicine, band aids, candy (andes mints are a favorite), cough drops, a bike lock, tape, a sharpie, my work badge and lanyard, deodorant, cleansing wipes, a wide-toothed comb and a detangling comb.</p>

<h2>What's not</h2>

<ul>
<li>A laptop</li>
</ul>

<p>It's too bulky to carry around all the time and I'm rarely in a situation where it would get any use. I'll bring it if I know I'll need it.</p>

<ul>
<li>A hacked 2DSXL</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a very good handheld, but again I don't have enough occasions to use it that it's worth being part of my EDC. But, it's indispensable on laundry day.</p>

<ul>
<li>A water bottle</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't find myself in many places with a water cooler or drinking fountain, so this wouldn't get much use either. I spend most of my time at home and work, where I drink from a glass.</p>

<h3>...but should be</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some kind of multitool</li>
</ul>

<p>My keychain is a carabiner-style clip with a few fold-out tools, but it was just a cheap promotional giveaway. I could stand to get a good one, or at the very least a decent knife.</p>

<ul>
<li>A proper first-aid kit</li>
</ul>

<p>I have some band-aids and OTC painkillers cuz that's what I need the most, but it's never a bad idea to have a more complete kit.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading 🦝</p>
