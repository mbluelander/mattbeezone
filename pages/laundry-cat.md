My apartment doesn't allow pets,[^sunny] but we have a lot of neighborhood cats. One Sunday (*`November 27, 2021`* to be precise) a black cat paid me a visit during my outing to the communal laundry room of my apartment complex, and I bestowed upon her the title of **Laundry Cat**. She started visiting most weeks, and it became a ritual for me to post a photo on fedi whenever she did.

> One day, we were visited by a *second cat*. Laundry cat was none too pleased with the visitor, and behaved in a way I found irresponsible. I tried to make Laundry Cat understand that she didn't need to compete, but she scared the second cat off and I haven't seen them since. I hope someday I can help Laundry Cat be more open-minded, but I still love her in spite of her flaws.

> My phone's camera isn't the best, and the laundry room isn't the best place to take photos. The sun is usually blasting through the open door while the rest of the laundry room is relatively dark, so the photos are often blown out and low-quality. This one was bad enough that I tried to edit it to make it a bit more presentable. I failed, but by making it black and white and messing with the contrast, I was able to make it look even more grimy and noir. Laundry Cat, *Eraserhead*-style

[^sunny]: We were able to get [Sunny](/sunny) thanks to her official designation as a medical service animal to help with our anxiety and PTSD. Is Sunny Laundry Cat's daughter? It's impossible to prove one way or the other, but I choose to believe she is.
