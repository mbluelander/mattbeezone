I've been creating game commentary videos in the form of "Let's Play"s on youtube since 2007 and live streams since 2011. My channel name is [Duke of the Bump](https://www.youtube.com/@dukeofthebump). If this is a genre of entertainment that interests you, here are some highlights:

[Matt & Mike Rank: Atari 2600 Games](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLmLpA-wOYpyHxom08z4DAozP58r8TdY): Attempting to rank every game on the most historic game console. On hold.

[Archipelago Live!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLmLpA-wOYrs6De73nFvBrN-fneqibh5): Streams of [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multi-world randomizers, also with Mike. Taking a brief pause.

[Dark Souls NG+](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLmLpA-wOYrQUa19cC5ROunMRtcG0LaQ): Solo streams of my New Game Plus experience, plus playing the DLC for the first time.
