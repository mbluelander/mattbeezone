Good news for Sunny fans! If you remember the charming fridge portrait that capped off the [kittens saga](/sunny-update), it's now available as a sticker!

Show off your good taste in critters and adorn your water bottle, laptop, or whatever other kind of objects humans own with an ode to the sphinx of black quartz in all of her photorealistic, color-accurate splendor. If you'd like to obtain this fine product for yourself, [simply click here](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Sunny-by-mattbeezone/170587080.EJUG5) and all of your wishes will come true. Her glorious visage is also available on magnets, coffee mugs, pillows, and some other products that aren't really suitable for this design but are available nonetheless.

But that's not all! Redbubble requires you to have five designs to open a shop, so four other designs are also available. Show off your state pride with a ["State Motto" sticker](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/State-Motto-2024-by-mattbeezone/170587563.EJUG5) (new for 2024!) or signal your mastery of [Quest For The Radiant Cake](https://bluelander.itch.io/slime-and-goo) with an official [Slime & Goo product](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Slime-and-Goo-sticker-by-mattbeezone/170590422.EJUG5). Accept no imitations!

All this and more now available at [Matt's Sticker Shack](https://www.redbubble.com/people/mattbeezone/shop?asc=u). You'll have to pay for shipping anyway, so why not buy several? Give em to your friends, they make great stocking stuffers. Christmas is only 7Â½ months away. Beat the rush!

To celebrate the shop's grand opening, I'm holding a contest. Can you name every reference in this site's banner image? [Click here to get a closer look.](/files/header.png) The background is from *Phantasy Star 4*, the ASCII cat is [kiki](/topics/kiki), and the title is from *Adventures of Lolo*. If you think you know the rest, <a href="/contact?subject=Contest Entry">click here to submit your entry.</a> There are eight games. The first three readers who name the most, and include their email address so I can respond, will win a small sticker of their choice. Good luck!
