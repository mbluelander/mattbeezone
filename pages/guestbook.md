sorry, hadn't read your newest post. my post below was a reaction to the one before it. Maybe LXDE or LXQT would work better as minimalist DEs. Also, you can have multiple DEs installed at the same time to try out. Most display managers (they should be called login managers tbh) like gdm and lightdm, let you switch between DE before logging in. You couod throw in some Tiling Window managers like i3 or Sway (depending on if you wanna switch from X11 to Wayland) Sorry if this is all a hassle. Just think you'd have a better time with literally anything but XF Feces. |

*I appreciate your concern, but the worst is over. I've got it set up the way I like and I plan to never touch it again. Plus, the mouse mascot is __very__ cute.*

Sorry, XF Feces is just awful. GNOME (with dash to panel) and KDE are the only Desktop Environments sort of ready for prime time. Well, there's Cinnamon and Mint's own highly customized version of Matte (literally everyone else's version of Matte besides Mint's sucks), but that's too in the weeds.. KDE and GNOME monolithic big boy desktops. Everyone else is a hodgepodge of pieces. There is technically one version of Windows with no tpm requirements that you might be interested in... (don't go back to windows lol it's not worth it). Think about it like this: Steamdecks don't ship with XFCE

I love that despite it all, and despite being a little mad at it, you are sticking to Linux and trying to learn and find what works best for you <3 I'm sorry that it hasn't been as smooth sailing as it should be and is for many.

*Thanks so much! I definitely think it'll be worth the effort. -Matt*

I hope they get you a new work computer. 7th gen is waaay too old for them to expect you to get stuff done.
