# About The Author

I'm matt bluelander. You can call me Matt Bee for short. 

I was born in nineteen eighty-five in Appalachia, a mountainous region of the eastern United States, where I currently reside with my spouse and cat. The land I live on rightfully belongs to the Tsalagi people. I'm [nonbinary](/topics/gender) $$nb$$ and my pronouns are they/them, but he/him or she/her don't bother me. Local time is UTC -5 (-4 during DST, Mar. 09 ‚Äî Nov. 02.)

I'm a [neurodivergent](/topics/neurodivergence) [anarchist](/topics/anarchism) [raccoon](/topics/raccoon&command=edit). By day I am a humble spreadsheet mechanic; by evening, I'm a writer and a programmer; by night, I am a sleepy critter. I'm trying my best to be a positive nihilist. I'm tired, but I have Izzy, my wonderful spouse, and she keeps me going ü¶ù‚ô•Ô∏èüêº

My current system is a [Thinkpad x250](/topics/computer) running Debian 12 with XFCE.

My favorite color is **purple**.

It is customary to display a list of my interests on the info page of a personal website, so you know if you should follow me, but I'm sort of interested in everything, and my level of interest in any particular thing waxes and wanes unpredictably. To be as broad and unhelpful as possible, I'm interested in sustainable technology, art, literature, music, games, history, science, politics, and law.
