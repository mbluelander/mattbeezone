I grew up with an abusive father and a neglectful mother. My dad is dead, which is good. My mom lives on the other side of the country, which is neutral. I'm glad for my independence, but if things go south in the country/in my life, I don't have parents I can move back in with, I'll just become homeless. It's not likely, but the possibility hanging over my head is one of many factors that contributes to my poor mental wellbeing.

My mother-in-law cares about me and my spouse very much, and does everything she can for us in spite of her struggles, which are many.
