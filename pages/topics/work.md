I currently have a full-time spreadsheet job at a hospital. I make $19.07 USD an hour. A few years ago, this would've been a lot of money to me. I was previously making $9.95/hr since being hired in 2021, so the pay raise was quite welcome; but the employer-sponsored health insurance costs a lot, and doesn't cover as much as when I was making $9.95/hr and receiving Medicaid. Additionally, a month after my pay increase, we elected a president who has vowed to destroy the US economy; two months after that, my rent increased by about 40%. Add in the ever-increasing price of groceries, and my higher paycheck doesn't stretch nearly as far as I had once hoped.
