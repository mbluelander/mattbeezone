# Crafting

Crafting is how I conceptualize most of my creative work. We often think of "crafting" as something done with physical materials, but I use words and code to craft digital objects like this website, [stories](/stories) and [computer games](/games). We already [think of writing as a craft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft), and I don't think it's a leap at all to think of other forms of digital creation as crafts.

Some of what I craft could be art, but I'm more comfortable thinking of myself as a crafter than an artist, since art is more subjective and undefinable. Plus, the term "art" is strongly linked to visual media, which isn't my strong suit. If anyone else thinks of something I make as art, I'm very flattered, but I'll probably always be uncomfortable self-identifying as an artist.
