I live in public housing, an apartment in a block built as a public works project during the FDR administration. The plan was to start renting an apartment or house once I started making more money, but a month after I started making more money, we elected a president who's vowed to destroy the US economy. The apartment isn't that bad, except that we don't have control over the heat; it's on from October-May no matter what temperature it is outside, so we often have to run the air conditioning in winter on days when it's too warm to just have a fan in the window. Also, we're subject to humiliating and dehumanizing monthly inspections, and the knowledge that someone from the government can enter my home at any time makes me feel fundamentally unsafe. Also, it's not in easy walking distance of anything. I wish we lived somewhere that felt like home, but I'm grateful to *have* a home when so many with my background don't.
