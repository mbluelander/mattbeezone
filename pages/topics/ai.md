Nothing on this site will ever knowingly be made with the use of generative AI. All of the text, except when quoting someone else, was written entirely by me. I occasionally use permissively-licensed resources from sites like [openclipart](https://openclipart.org) and [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org). To the best of my knowledge, nothing I use was made by generative AI. If you know of any such material here please <a href="https://mattbee.zone/contact?subject=AI Use">let me know.</a>

My work is [permissively licensed](/license) for use by other people. Nothing on this site may be scraped or used in any way for the purpose of training large language models or other machine learning applications. Permission will not be given.

I had a whole spiel here, but I'm annoyed that I felt obligated to provide an argument. If the sole justification for something people don't like is "this is the future, get used to it", allow me to offer a rebuttal with the same level of nuance: "no."
