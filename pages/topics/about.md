Topic pages are concise articles on a single subject, usually related to my identity, experiences or beliefs; articles about other subjects I reference frequently may appear here as well.

Due to the efficient nature of Topics pages, no landing page is provided: you can use the [tags view](/&tag=topics) to view all articles at once (if you see **AI** below this article, you're already there); or, for an indexed list of links, see the [Everything](/everything) page.
