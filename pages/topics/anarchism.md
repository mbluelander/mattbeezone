I'm a [leftist](/topics/leftism) who avoided more specific categorization for a long time; I finally realized that "anarchist" is the only label that makes sense for me. That all humans have the right to self-determination and a life free from rulers and oppressive hierarchical systems is the fundamental principle by which a humane society must be organized. Nation states in their current form are systems that exist for the protection and advancement of global hegemonic capital. The United States is the beating heart of this system, and it above all other states must be abolished. 

Anarchism does not imply inherent opposition to government; systems of governance must exist to facilitate the survival and flourishing of humanity, especially taking care of the sick and disabled. I don't think "government" needs to be synonymous with "state". A humane government might resemble something we call communism, or socialism, or syndicalism, or democracy, but whatever name it's given, it will be something new, and we won't see it within our lifetimes. I think a successful egalitarian model will most likely be a federation of small independent states, with action at scale being facilitated by a representative democracy---not unlike the original foundational vision of the United States, except, of course... *actually* egalitarian, and not a patriarchal capitalist slave state with a slapdash coat of enlightenment paint.

I'm not an accelerationist. If the state were suddenly abolished with nothing to replace it, it would cause untold human suffering. This is my personal philosophy, and nothing here constitutes a political action plan. I have no formal [education](/topics/education), power or inclination towards leadership; I'm just a humble raccoon trying to make sense of a world that wasn't made for me. I will try to do whatever little good I can with the hand I've been dealt, and keep dreaming of a better world.
