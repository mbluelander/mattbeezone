My current computer is a [Thinkpad x250 laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series#X250), released in 2015. I bought it used many years ago to use as a portable computer; when my desktop computer died, it became my main workstation. I keep it connected to a monitor, keyboard and mouse at all times. It ran Windows 7 until April 2025, when I decided to start using linux. After a false start with Fedora, I [installed Debian 12 with XFCE](https://bluelander.bearblog.dev/linux-pause/) on April 15, 2025, and it's been serving me well since. It's still quite functional for most of my use cases, and can even stream gameplay footage at 480p, but I do sometimes wish I had a computer that could run newer games.
