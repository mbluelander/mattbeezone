I've discussed my [anarchism](/topics/anarchism), but for the record, here are some of my specific political beliefs:

* Abolish capitalism
* Abolish the carceral state
* Abolish private property
* Black lives matter
* Bodily autonomy for all
* Children are not property
* Dispossess the rich
* End empire
* Free Palestine
* Land back to indigenous peoples
* Mutual aid
* Punch nazis
* Reparations for BIPOC
* Trans & queer liberation now
* Universal food, housing and healthcare

I don't often draw attention to these beliefs, because without [action](/topics/activism&command=edit) they can come across as hollow and self-congratulatory; in social media contexts, I'd rather boost the voices of the oppressed and those working to change oppressive systems than highlight my own righteousness, but this is my own personal encyclopedia, and that's where this sort of content goes. These principles are peppered throughout all my writing, and I'll express a political opinion if I think it's novel or offers particular clarity on a subject.
