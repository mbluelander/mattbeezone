I try to keep the [topics](/&tag=topics) brief for ease of legibility, but some topics, such as [neurodivergence](/topics/neurodivergence), may be ones that I feel require additional context to fully express my understanding of it. Due to my limited time and mental energy, these topics may evolve over time and are likely to be revised multiple times.
