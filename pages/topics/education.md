I should've graduated from high school in 2003, but due to a [violent home life](/topics/parents) and untreated mental illness, I didn't have enough credits to graduate. I got my high school equivalency degree in 2005. To escape the violence, I had to leave home and begin working full-time as soon as I turned 18. I'd love to go back to school, but I currently have no choice but to [work](/topics/work) to support myself and my spouse, and my [disability](/topics/neurodivergence&command=edit) makes me unable to do coursework on top of 40-hour work weeks. I qualify for various grants and loans, but as far as I know, no resources are available that would cover my family's living expenses while I go back to school full-time. At my therapist and others' recommendation I've looked into various online school-like programs, and not only do they not cover living expense either, but unsurprisingly they've [all turned out to be scams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_Institute_of_Technology). I try to learn as much as I can on my own, but I hope I can somehow, someday enjoy a formal higher education.
