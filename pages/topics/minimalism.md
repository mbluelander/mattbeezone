I wouldn't describe myself as "a minimalist"---I try not to think of myself as an ideological *anything*---but I definitely think I'm a lot happier with very little stuff, and that most of the stuff society has conditioned us to want makes our lives worse. You can read more on the archived blog post [When I Ended My Relationship With Stuff](no-more-stuff), and read about a few of the things that *do* improve my life at [Every Day Carry](/archive/edc) and [Computer](/topics/computer).

It's obvious, but I feel compelled to mention that the ideology of stuff is hugely responsible for accelerating the destruction of the planet, and we should all try our best to want less things. If you haven't seen it, I recommend [The Story of Stuff](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM), it's an oldie but a goodie. The 2012 documentary [The Queen of Versailles](https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/queen-versailles-0) also helped me see just what a scam this all is.
