Kiki is a tiny homepage construction kit by vga256 of [Tomodashi Industrial](https://tomodashi.com/home). It's written in PHP and designed with [a set of principles](https://tomodashi.com/philosophy) that aligns strongly with my own. You can get the shareware version on [itch.io](https://tomo-dashi.itch.io/kiki) to try it out, and if you want the full version (including wiki functionality) it's currently $15CAD/$11USD. It's been well worth the cost, and I've had more fun building this site than any of my prior forays into web design.
